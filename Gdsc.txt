"Hello, my name is Collins Omondi, and I am an Applied biolgy  student at The kisumu national polytechnic. I am excited to apply for the position of GDSC Lead, and I wanted to take a few minutes to introduce myself and share why I believe I would be a good fit for this role.

I have always been passionate about technology and innovation, and I believe that the GDSC is an excellent platform for students to learn, grow and make a real impact in their communities. As a GDSC Lead, I want to inspire and engage students in tech-related activities, and help build a supportive community around technology in our college.

I have had some experience leading teams and organizing events, which I believe will help me in this role. Last year, I served as the event organizer for our department's annual tech fest, where I managed a team of volunteers and coordinated a range of activities, including coding contests, tech quizzes, and workshops.

I am also an active member of the coding club, where I have learned a great deal about programming languages such as Python and JavaScript. I have participated in several hackathons and coding competitions, and I believe that my technical expertise and creativity will help me in my role as a GDSC Lead.

My vision for the GDSC is to create an inclusive and collaborative environment where students can learn and grow together. I want to organize regular meetups, workshops, and speaker sessions, where students can learn about emerging technologies, network with industry experts, and share their ideas and experiences. I believe that by creating such a community, we can help students build the skills and confidence they need to pursue their passions and achieve their goals.

In conclusion, I am excited about the opportunity to serve as the GDSC Lead and help build a thriving tech community at our college. I encourage all students who share my passion for technology to get involved with the GDSC and join me in this exciting journey. Thank you!"
